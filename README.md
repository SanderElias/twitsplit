This is a personal project. I do fumble around with it from time to time.
The reason I made this, was because I was typing tweets that didn't fit the 140 chr limit, and needed something a tad smarter to split them up, and insert numbering.

Then I started to play around with emoji, I never realized there where so many. very much still a work in progress, but usefull as is.

I didn't put in any styling (yet), aside from using [Angular Flex-layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout), and some borders.
